### **Creating and Linking Notes**

One of the most powerful feature is [[page link feature]]. This looks fairly simple on paper but it coupled with the graph view and the backlink access can provide a really powerful experience for the consumer.

### Structured Data with Tables

Utilize tables to systematically organize data, such as API endpoints or project configurations, ensuring information is readily accessible and clearly presented.

| Endpoint        | Method | Description              |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------------|
| /api/forge      | POST   | Creates a new artifact   |
| /api/forge/:id  | GET    | Retrieves an artifact    |
### Embedding Code Snippets

Incorporate code snippets directly into your documentation, providing real-world examples and usage scenarios that enhance understanding and implementation.

```JS
// Function to summon an HTTP request
const summonRequest = async (url) => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  return response.json();
}
```

#### Leveraging Backlinks

Backlinks help in identifying the interconnections between documentation sections, offering insights into related components and their interactions.
### Advantages

- - **Advanced Markdown Capabilities**: Developers gain access to an enriched markdown editing environment with Obsidian, requiring minimal initial setup. The Obsidian desktop application is straightforward to download and integrate into our workflow.
- **Extensive Community Support**: The benefit of a broad selection of open-source plugins, courtesy of Obsidian's active community, significantly enhances our documentation process. This array of tools can refine and streamline our documentation efforts, promoting efficiency.
- **Seamless GitHub Integration**: Our documentation process is fully integrated with GitHub, allowing for reviews and approvals directly within our development workflow. This integration fosters team collaboration and embeds documentation as a pivotal element of our project lifecycle.
- **User-Centric Documentation Approach**: We emulate a single-page documentation experience akin to that of renowned platforms like Confluence. This approach ensures documentation is user-friendly, with shareable links that facilitate easy access and collaboration.
- **Control and Transparency**: Hosting and managing our documentation in-house provides us with full control over the creation and maintenance process. Additionally, utilizing Git for version control ensures transparency and historical tracking of all documentation changes.

#### Disadvantages

- **Configuration Constraints**: Our current repository setup might present limitations regarding configuration flexibility.
